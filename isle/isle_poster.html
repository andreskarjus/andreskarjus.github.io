<li>Embed targets into vector space (LSA) of the preceding decade, compute semantic neighbors</li>
<li>Important: word occurrence probabilities sum up to 1; increase in x =&gt; decrease in y.</li>
<li>The measure: where probability mass gets equalized, i.e., target increase<span class="math inline">\(\geq \sum_{}^{}\)</span>(neighbors’ decreases). Either cosine distance, or n increasing neighbors.</li>
<li>Indicates if the increasing target replaced semantically close word(s) (direct competition, obvious likely source of probability mass).</li>
