- I was co-organizing a workshop titled *Drift, selection, change, and shift* that was supposed to take place at Evolang2020 in April. Unfortunately the conference got (understandably) cancelled due to the world being on fire. We had a great lineup of speakers planned though [(workshop homepage here)](https://driftselection-evolang2020.github.io/) and hope to reconvene next year.

- My first PhD paper (that's been out as a preprint since summer 2018) is now published in Language Dynamics and Change: [Karjus, A., Blythe, R. A., Kirby, S., & Smith, K. (2020). Quantifying the dynamics of topical fluctuations in language](https://doi.org/10.1163/22105832-01001200)
