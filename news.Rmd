- Gave an online CLE talk about my recent PhD research on lexical competition and colexification (31.03.2020) | [slides](https://andreskarjus.github.io/cletalk2020) | [recording](https://youtu.be/-utY5ERe6OY)

- I was co-organizing a workshop titled *Drift, selection, change, and shift* that was supposed to take place at Evolang2020 in April. Unfortunately the conference got (understandably) cancelled due to the world being on fire. We had a great lineup of speakers planned though [(workshop homepage here)](https://driftselection-evolang2020.github.io/) and hope to reconvene next year.

- My first PhD paper (that's been out as a preprint since summer 2018) is now published in Language Dynamics and Change: [Karjus, A., Blythe, R. A., Kirby, S., & Smith, K. (2020). Quantifying the dynamics of topical fluctuations in language](https://doi.org/10.1163/22105832-01001200)

- Delivered another dataviz workshop, this time for the University of Edinburgh Centre for Data, Culture and Society (01.11.2019)

- Presenting a talk at the [RUSE 2019](http://rusesymposium.org.uk/), the Symposium on Representations, Usage and Social Embedding in Language Change (a slightly updated version of the CL2019 talk). Slides [here](https://andreskarjus.github.io/ruse2019).

- Presented a talk on lexical competition at the [CL2019](http://www.cl2019.org/). Slides with interactive plots [here](https://andreskarjus.github.io/cl2019talk.html). Also teaching a dataviz [workshop](https://andreskarjus.github.io/artofthefigure/cl2019).

- Presenting an updated version of the communivative need & lexical competition poster at the [Culture Conference 2019](https://culture-conference.com/programme-2019/) in Stirling, 1-2 July 2019. Online version with interactive plots [here](https://andreskarjus.github.io/lexcom_poster). More languages this time!

- I'll be teaching workshops at the following venues this summer: [SCOSYA Data Hack](https://scotssyntaxatlas.ac.uk/workshops/data-hack/), [SGSSS Summer School](https://www.sgsss.ac.uk/summer-school-2019/), [SGSAH Summer School](https://www.sgsah.ac.uk/news/summerschool/), [Digital Humanities Conference 2019](https://dh2019.adho.org/), [International Corpus Linguistics Conference 2019](http://www.cl2019.org/). All materials are/will be available [here](https://andreskarjus.github.io/artofthefigure/).

- Taught an aRt of the Figure series workshop for the Corpus Linguistics in Scotland network (12.04), titled [Data visualization with R for corpus linguists](https://andreskarjus.github.io/artofthefigure)

- Edinburgh Language Lunch 11.04: (re-)presented the "Modelling lexical interactions in diachronic corpora" poster, originally presented at the [Inaugural ISLE workshop](https://www.comparativelinguistics.uzh.ch/en/events/ISLE-inaugural-workshop.html), here is an [online version with interactive plots](https://andreskarjus.github.io/isle_poster) and an (updated!) appendix.

- The Language Evolves school workshops are [finished for 2018/2019](https://twitter.com/kennysmithed/status/1113456451815661568), with Hermitage Park Primary being the last one. Happy to have been part of it.

- Poster to be presented at the [Inaugural ISLE workshop](https://www.comparativelinguistics.uzh.ch/en/events/ISLE-inaugural-workshop.html) in April, here is an online [version with interactive plots](https://andreskarjus.github.io/isle_poster).

- Entered [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8InfFEIINc) to Science Magazine's 11th [Dance Your Ph.D contest](https://www.sciencemag.org/projects/dance-your-phd). The idea is to explain your research topic to the general public though interpretive dance.
