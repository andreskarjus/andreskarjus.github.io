- Distributional semantics, meaning from data

- Embed targets into vector space (LSA) of preceding decade, compute semantic neighbors

---
# Quantifying competition

- Important: word occurrence probabilities sum up to 1; increase in x means decrease in y.
--

- The measure: *where* the probability mass gets equalized, i.e., target increase $\geq \sum_{}^{}$ (neighbors' decreases). Either cosine distance, or n increasing neighbors.
- Indicates if the increasing target replaced semantically close word(s) (direct competition, obvious likely source of probability mass).

# Communicative need 

- Model diachronic topical fluctuations by quantifying the frequency change of a word's topic.
- The topical-cultural advection model; proxy to communicative need
- _advection_: 'the transport of substance, particularly fluids, by bulk motion'
- Formalized as the _weighted mean of the log frequency changes of the relevant topic (context) words of the target word_


---
# How does this work?

- Generate a "topic" for each target word, consisting of _m_ associated context words
<img src="img/tcm_anim.mov.gif" width="80%" height="50%"/>
 -  weighted mean frequency change of topic/context words e.g. _cafe_, _cappuchino_ .small[(these are removed from the list of neighbours)]

---

# How well does it work?

- Correlate the log frequency changes of all (sufficiently frequent) nouns between two time periods to their respective topical advection values
- describes ~20-40% variance in word frequency changes between the 20 decades in COHA
- Comparable results from LDA

# Discussion

- Controlling for a range of factors, communicative need (operationalized by advection), describes a small amount of variance in competitive interactions between words
    - low advection words are more likely to replace a word with a similar meaning
--
    - high advection words: less likely (prob.mass from elsewhere)
--
    - tested against a random baseline
--

- Real effect could be bigger?
    - Just words; messy population aggregates; messy ML
    - But also, this approach relies on a *lot* of parameters
--
- How does this relate to individual utterance selection processes?

# Conclusions 

- Communicative need describes a small amount of variance in competitive interactions between words in diachronic corpora
- Presumably high communicative need facilitates the co-existence of similar words.
--

- Future directions: explore parameters; test with phrases; more corpora; implement with non-discrete spans, modern semantics models .small[ (e.g. temporal referencing, Dubossarsky et al 2019) ]; test this experimentally.

# Notes on the competition measure 

<div style="font-size:14pt; line-height:25px">

- We made sure to avoid auto-correlation between the advection measure and the dependent variable by filtering the neighbour lists of each target so that no topic word of the target (i.e. those with a PPMI>0 with the target, which are used to calculate the advection value) would be accounted for as a neighbor. This also makes sense from a semantic point of view: if two words, even if very similar occur near each other (e.g., "salt and pepper"), then it's less palusible that they would be competing against one another. Exceptions are certainly possible, such as meta-linguistic descriptions (e.g., "vapor, previously spelled as vapour"), but we assume these would be rare.<br>
- We also filtered out a small subset of target words with considerably higher-than-expected lexical dissemination (a proxy to polysemy, cf. Stewart & Eisenstein 2018), and those with a leftover probability mass >100% of its frequency. <br>
- We did not make use of the entire Corpus of Historical American English, as most of the 19th century decades are less balanced and smaller in size, the imbalance extends to the occurrence of non-standard dialects or registers in occasional year subcorpora. Similarly, we only used years after 1800 in the German corpus. The Estonian corpus only spans two decades, 1990s and 2000s, so all comparisons were done between these two, without accounting for exact starting years of each word's increase.<br>
- This approach certainly has limitations stemming from the imperfect nature of corpus tagging, composition balance, and vector semantics (LSA). We also disregard issues such as homonymy (although we control for polysemy in the targets) and multi-word units.<br>
- We ran randomized baselines to make sure the observed correlation with advection is not some (unknown) artefact of the machine learning models used here. This was done by randomizing similarity matrices, i.e. each target was assigned a random list of neighbors, with random similarity values (drawn from the concatenation of all similarity vectors). After hundreds of iterations, the advection variable would come out with a p-value below 0.05 in only about 5% of the runs (i.e., as expected with an $\alpha=0.05$).<br>
- Some outliers are removed on the bottom left plot on the distributions of distances and neighbors until probability mass equalized.

# Quantifying competition 

- Distributional semantics, meaning from data
<img src="img/tcm_anim.mov.gif" width="80%" />
- Embed targets into vector space (LSA) of preceding decade, compute semantic neighbors

---
# Quantifying competition

- Important: word occurrence probabilities sum up to 1; increase in x means decrease in y.
--

- The measure: *where* the probability mass gets equalized, i.e., target increase $\geq \sum_{}^{}$ (neighbors' decreases). Either cosine distance, or n increasing neighbors.
- Indicates if the increasing target replaced semantically close word(s) (direct competition, obvious likely source of probability mass).

# Communicative need 

- Model diachronic topical fluctuations by quantifying the frequency change of a word's topic.
- The topical-cultural advection model; proxy to communicative need
- _advection_: 'the transport of substance, particularly fluids, by bulk motion'
- Formalized as the _weighted mean of the log frequency changes of the relevant topic (context) words of the target word_


---
# How does this work?

- Generate a "topic" for each target word, consisting of _m_ associated context words
<img src="img/tcm_anim.mov.gif" width="80%" height="50%"/>
 -  weighted mean frequency change of topic/context words e.g. _cafe_, _cappuchino_ .small[(these are removed from the list of neighbours)]

---

# How well does it work?

- Correlate the log frequency changes of all (sufficiently frequent) nouns between two time periods to their respective topical advection values
- describes ~20-40% variance in word frequency changes between the 20 decades in COHA
- Comparable results from LDA

# Discussion

- Controlling for a range of factors, communicative need (operationalized by advection), describes a small amount of variance in competitive interactions between words
    - low advection words are more likely to replace a word with a similar meaning
--
    - high advection words: less likely (prob.mass from elsewhere)
--
    - tested against a random baseline
--

- Real effect could be bigger?
    - Just words; messy population aggregates; messy ML
    - But also, this approach relies on a *lot* of parameters
--
- How does this relate to individual utterance selection processes?

# Conclusions 

- Communicative need describes a small amount of variance in competitive interactions between words in diachronic corpora
- Presumably high communicative need facilitates the co-existence of similar words.
--

- Future directions: explore parameters; test with phrases; more corpora; implement with non-discrete spans, modern semantics models .small[ (e.g. temporal referencing, Dubossarsky et al 2019) ]; test this experimentally.

# Notes on the competition measure 

<div style="font-size:14pt; line-height:25px">

- We made sure to avoid auto-correlation between the advection measure and the dependent variable by filtering the neighbour lists of each target so that no topic word of the target (i.e. those with a PPMI>0 with the target, which are used to calculate the advection value) would be accounted for as a neighbor. This also makes sense from a semantic point of view: if two words, even if very similar occur near each other (e.g., "salt and pepper"), then it's less palusible that they would be competing against one another. Exceptions are certainly possible, such as meta-linguistic descriptions (e.g., "vapor, previously spelled as vapour"), but we assume these would be rare.<br>
- We also filtered out a small subset of target words with considerably higher-than-expected lexical dissemination (a proxy to polysemy, cf. Stewart & Eisenstein 2018), and those with a leftover probability mass >100% of its frequency. <br>
- We did not make use of the entire Corpus of Historical American English, as most of the 19th century decades are less balanced and smaller in size, the imbalance extends to the occurrence of non-standard dialects or registers in occasional year subcorpora. Similarly, we only used years after 1800 in the German corpus. The Estonian corpus only spans two decades, 1990s and 2000s, so all comparisons were done between these two, without accounting for exact starting years of each word's increase.<br>
- This approach certainly has limitations stemming from the imperfect nature of corpus tagging, composition balance, and vector semantics (LSA). We also disregard issues such as homonymy (although we control for polysemy in the targets) and multi-word units.<br>
- We ran randomized baselines to make sure the observed correlation with advection is not some (unknown) artefact of the machine learning models used here. This was done by randomizing similarity matrices, i.e. each target was assigned a random list of neighbors, with random similarity values (drawn from the concatenation of all similarity vectors). After hundreds of iterations, the advection variable would come out with a p-value below 0.05 in only about 5% of the runs (i.e., as expected with an $\alpha=0.05$).<br>
- Some outliers are removed on the bottom left plot on the distributions of distances and neighbors until probability mass equalized.
